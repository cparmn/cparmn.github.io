## Writing my first Python scripts.
I've been told numerous times that I'm picky, but I believe that is just because I have high expectations.  That being said, I can only be picky if it’s something I truly understand.  My first Python scripts I will not be picky about, because I'm still learning the best way to accomplish a task. If you notice that I'm making it hard then it needs to be place let me know.
As we know, no products are perfect, but many products now include a REST API that allows us to gather information and perform various task.  In these python scripts I’m going to be utilizing the REST API to accomplish my goals.
### Goals
The goal of script is to utilize Carbon Black Response’s REST API in order to manipulate cold storage partitions. 
>Place Carbon Black Storage Partition Information here reference _cbevents and cbevents
#### Warning
I’m running these scripts on the Carbon Black Response server, I was unable to use Python 2.6 and I was required to side load Python 2.7.  Do not attempt this if you are unsure what you are doing as you could render your Carbon Black Response services useless.
